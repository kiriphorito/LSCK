  <h3>Imagine Cup 2017</h3>
  <p>Since our client is Microsoft and our project was designed with Microsoft Visual Studio in mind. We decided that it would be good to submit our project is Microsoft's Imagine Cup 2017. Our team name is Javisam and our project title is Lightweight Start-up Company Kit (LSCK).</p>

  <h3>Set-Backs and Issues</h3>
  <p>As a team, we have had a number of set-backs which has led us to feel that we are behind the schedule. Firstly, we only have two members in this project rather than three and also we didn’t manage to meet our client until the 8th week of the project. It was only then we found that our initial assumptions from the brief given were wrong making our experiments, research and prototypes where completely incorrect.</p>
  <p>Given these setbacks, we as a team are still moving ahead to get this project completed.</p>
